            Day 1:
        </h3>
        <p>
            I've decided to keep some note to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been 1 day since making the wish. My life had changed... or maybe it has not? Everyone acted as if I had been a girl my whole life. Everything feels both so natural and as if I have been transported to a different world altogether. I used to not having any friends. But today, when I get to school, I was greeted with a few girls I was not familiar with, and they took me with them to lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being included as one of the girls feel nice. Even though I couldn't follow any of their conversations. Girls' talk are so confusing.
        </p>

            Oh. I met with Kyubey today also. He took me out to do some "witch hunt" as he calls it. It is my duty to fight witches from now on as a magical girl, he said. I don't know what Witches are... maybe I'll ask him when I meet him later.
        </p>

            Mom and dad was so angry when I got home late today. They were already calling my school to ask for why I wasn't home. They said they would confiscate my phone for a week if I don't return home by 6 next time. They yelled at me again... I should try to go home sooner next time.
