                    I worried about Kouga-sempai's sake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since our friendgroup lost Simon-sempai, Sorae-sempai and Souten-sempai, everyone has been acting weirdly. Rumi-chan were distant, Takao senpai seems quiet and reserved. And Kouga-sempai?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yesterday, we talked together. He was a wreck. He was trying so hard to carry everyone's hope, even when things feel so dire and lost. I wish I could do more. If only, if only I wasn't so weak. I must have burdened him so much. I feel so guilty about myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He hasn't been resting well lately. He didn't even use a grief seed the last time we fought. He handed it to Takao-sempai and me, telling me to use them to heal ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't use it. I still kept it with me. I want to give it to him, but I need to heal too, my gem has been murky recently...
                </p>
                <p>
                    What worth would I bring with my magic anyway? I can't lead everyone. I can't fight on my own. I leeched on their hands, while doing barely anything to help. He would deserve it more than I do.

                    That string you held since the beginning.

                    Rip it apart. Until they are nothing more than <b>tattered</b> remains.
